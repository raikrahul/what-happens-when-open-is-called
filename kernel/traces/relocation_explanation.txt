This is a **Work Order** for the Loader.

`000000003fd0  ... R_X86_64_JUMP_SLO ... open ...`

It means:
1.  **Where**: Go to address `0x3fd0` (The Mailbox).
2.  **What**: Find the real address of `open`.
3.  **Action**: Write it there.

Remember the **Impossible Jump**?
`jmp *0x3fd0`
The code jumps to `3fd0` because the Loader promised to put the answer there.
