USER RULES (THE PRIMATE SYSTEM):
01. USE PURE ASCII ONLY.
02. NO EXTRA CHARACTERS.
03. NO LATEX SYMBOLS.

05. ZERO HEADINGS.
06. ZERO FILLER WORDS.
07. ZERO LABELS.
08. NO WORDS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE VALUE.
09. FORMAT: Input -> Computation -> Output.

11. FROM SCRATCH: Derive everything from axioms. No "news" (unexplained info).
12. AXIOMATIC LINEAGE:

    - Line N uses only 1 to N-1.
    - No forward references ("we will see later", "as mentioned below").
13. DERIVATION: If Line N uses X, Line N-1 must have calculated/derived X.
14. REJECTION CRITERIA: If "NEW THINGS INTRODUCED WITHOUT DERIVATION" list is not empty, file is REJECTED.



If dealing with Coding the following are banned 

- talking nonsense and un needed about struuct offsets which are useless 
- talking about registers which are useless to the problem
- talking about size of or calculating size of structs or variables or pointers which are useless for the issue
